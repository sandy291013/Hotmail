In the address bar, type in the URL ``outlook.com`` and hit enter. This will redirect you to the Microsoft login page where you can sign in to your Hotmail account.

Once you’ve signed in, you will have full access to your Hotmail account, including your inbox, calendar, contacts, and any other services tied to your Microsoft account.

### 2.3 Logging in via Microsoft Authenticator (Optional)

3. **Common Login Issues and Troubleshooting Tips**
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, despite following all the steps correctly, you may encounter issues while trying to log in to your Hotmail account. Let’s look at some of the most common login issues and how to troubleshoot them:

### 3.1 Incorrect Password or Username
If you’re sure that your Hotmail credentials are correct but still can’t log in, here’s what you can do:

- **Double-Check Your Credentials**: Ensure you’ve entered the correct email address and password. Pay attention to case sensitivity.
- **Reset Your Password**: If you’ve forgotten your password or suspect it has been changed, you can reset it. On the sign-in page, click on the “Forgot password?” link and follow the instructions to reset your password via email or text message.

### 3.2 Two-Factor Authentication Issues
If you have two-factor authentication enabled and are not receiving your verification code, you can:

- **Check Your Phone**: Ensure your phone is connected to the internet and that you have received the code via text or email.
- **Use Backup Codes**: When you set up two-factor authentication, Microsoft provides backup codes that can be used if you don’t have access to your phone or primary authentication method.

### 3.3 Account Locked
If Microsoft suspects suspicious activity on your account, they may temporarily lock it to protect your information. You may be asked to verify your identity through an alternative email or phone number. Follow the instructions on the screen to unlock your account.

### 3.4 Browser or App Issues
If you’re using a web browser and encountering issues, try the following:

- **Clear Cache and Cookies**: Old browser data can cause login issues. Clearing your browser’s cache and cookies can resolve this.
- **Try Another Browser**: If your default browser isn’t working, try accessing your Hotmail account via a different browser.
- **Reinstall the App**: If the Outlook app is malfunctioning, try uninstalling and reinstalling it.

### 3.5 Security Issues and Phishing Attempts
If you suspect that someone else is attempting to access your Hotmail account or if you’ve received a suspicious email asking for your login details:

- **Change Your Password**: Immediately change your Hotmail password to something strong and unique.
